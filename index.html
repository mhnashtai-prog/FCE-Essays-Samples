        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">Few issues have divided opinion as much as</span> environmental destruction. <span class="opinion">Without doubt, I firmly believe that</span> <span class="vocabulary">pollution and environmental damage</span> can be <span class="vocabulary">effectively addressed</span> through <span class="causal">a combination of</span> technological innovation, strict regulations, and individual responsibility.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Firstly</span>, <span class="causal">the main reason is that</span> <span class="vocabulary">sustainable transport systems</span> can <span class="vocabulary">dramatically reduce</span> emissions. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, many cities have introduced electric buses and expanded metro networks. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, air quality has improved significantly in these areas. <span class="causal">This is largely because</span> fewer private vehicles are needed when <span class="vocabulary">efficient public transport</span> is available.</p>

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">In today's world, it is not uncommon to see</span> fashion <span class="vocabulary">dominating</span> social media and popular culture. <span class="causal">There has been considerable debate about</span> whether the fashion industry benefits or harms society. <span class="opinion">From my perspective, I firmly believe that</span> fashion has <span class="vocabulary">a predominantly negative effect</span> on people's lives <span class="causal">due to</span> its creation of <span class="vocabulary">unrealistic standards</span>, <span class="vocabulary">financial pressures</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">environmental damage</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">First and foremost</span>, <span class="causal">the key disadvantage is that</span> the fashion industry creates <span class="vocabulary">unrealistic appearance expectations</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, advertisements constantly show <span class="vocabulary">impossibly perfect models</span> and promote the idea that people must follow <span class="vocabulary">ever-changing trends</span> to be <span class="vocabulary">socially acceptable</span>. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, many individuals, especially young people, <span class="vocabulary">develop low self-esteem</span> and <span class="vocabulary">body image issues</span>. <span class="causal">This is largely because</span> they feel <span class="vocabulary">inadequate</span> when comparing themselves to these <span class="vocabulary">unrealistic ideals</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In addition</span>, <span class="causal">another significant problem is that</span> fashion encourages <span class="vocabulary">excessive spending</span> that many cannot afford. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, designer clothing and accessories often cost <span class="vocabulary">hundreds or even thousands of pounds</span>. <span class="causal">Consequently</span>, people may <span class="vocabulary">fall into debt</span> trying to <span class="vocabulary">keep up with trends</span>. <span class="causal">This happens because</span> society places enormous pressure on individuals to wear <span class="vocabulary">fashionable, expensive items</span> to <span class="vocabulary">gain social acceptance</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="causal">a pressing concern is that</span> the fashion industry causes <span class="vocabulary">severe environmental damage</span>. <span class="discourse">Consider the case of</span> "fast fashion" companies that produce <span class="vocabulary">cheap, disposable clothing</span>, which quickly ends up in landfills.

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I am convinced that</span> the fashion industry has <span class="vocabulary">more harmful than beneficial effects</span> on society. <span class="discourse">All things considered</span>, the industry needs <span class="vocabulary">significant reform</span> to <span class="vocabulary">address</span> its negative impacts on <span class="vocabulary">mental health</span>, <span class="vocabulary">financial wellbeing</span>, and the environment.</p>`

<p><span class="discourse">First of all</span>, <span class="causal">the most important factor is that</span> learning languages provides <span class="vocabulary">genuine pleasure and enrichment</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, knowing another language allows people to <span class="vocabulary">enjoy foreign films</span> without subtitles, read <span class="vocabulary">literature in its original form</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">appreciate different cultures</span> more deeply. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, learners <span class="vocabulary">gain access to</span> <span class="vocabulary">diverse perspectives</span> and ways of thinking. <span class="causal">This is because</span> language <span class="vocabulary">carries cultural nuances</span> that <span class="vocabulary">translations cannot fully capture</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In addition</span>, <span class="causal">another significant benefit is that</span> languages offer <span class="vocabulary">rewarding personal challenges</span> that <span class="vocabulary">enhance cognitive abilities</span>. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, mastering <span class="vocabulary">complex grammar structures</span> and building vocabulary <span class="vocabulary">improves memory</span> and <span class="vocabulary">problem-solving skills</span>. <span class="causal">Consequently</span>, learners <span class="vocabulary">develop greater confidence</span> and a sense of <span class="vocabulary">personal achievement</span>. <span class="causal">This stems from</span> the satisfaction of <span class="vocabulary">overcoming difficult obstacles</span> through <span class="vocabulary">persistent effort</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="causal">one important advantage is that</span> foreign languages <span class="vocabulary">dramatically enhance</span> career prospects. <span class="discourse">Consider the case of</span> international companies that <span class="vocabulary">actively seek</span> employees with <span class="vocabulary">multilingual capabilities</span>.

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I am in total agreement that</span> language learning offers <span class="vocabulary">far-reaching benefits</span> beyond simply <span class="vocabulary">passing tests</span>. <span class="discourse">Taking everything into account</span>, education systems should <span class="vocabulary">emphasize</span> the <span class="vocabulary">practical applications</span> and <span class="vocabulary">lifelong advantages</span> that languages provide.</p>`

<p><span class="discourse">First and foremost</span>, <span class="causal">the key advantage is that</span> national history teaches <span class="vocabulary">crucial lessons</span> from previous <span class="vocabulary">successes and failures</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, studying how <span class="vocabulary">wars began</span>, how <span class="vocabulary">political systems collapsed</span>, or how <span class="vocabulary">social injustices</span> were eventually <span class="vocabulary">addressed</span> helps citizens <span class="vocabulary">recognize similar patterns</span> today. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, societies can <span class="vocabulary">make more informed decisions</span> and <span class="vocabulary">avoid repeating historical errors</span>. <span class="causal">This is largely because</span> understanding the <span class="vocabulary">causes and consequences</span> of past events <span class="vocabulary">provides guidance</span> for <span class="vocabulary">navigating present challenges</span>.</p>

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">In today's world, it is not uncommon to see</span> <span class="vocabulary">online shopping</span> <span class="vocabulary">rapidly expanding</span> while traditional stores <span class="vocabulary">struggle to survive</span>. <span class="causal">There has been considerable debate about whether</span> <span class="vocabulary">e-commerce</span> is <span class="vocabulary">superior to</span> conventional retail. <span class="opinion">From my perspective</span>, while online shopping offers <span class="vocabulary">clear advantages</span> in terms of convenience, it also has <span class="vocabulary">significant drawbacks</span> that make traditional stores <span class="vocabulary">valuable</span> for certain purposes.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">On the one hand</span>, <span class="causal">the main advantage is that</span> online shopping provides <span class="vocabulary">unmatched convenience</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, shoppers can <span class="vocabulary">browse</span> and <span class="vocabulary">purchase products</span> 24 hours a day from <span class="vocabulary">the comfort of their homes</span>, easily <span class="vocabulary">compare prices</span> across multiple retailers, and have items <span class="vocabulary">delivered directly</span> to their door. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, people <span class="vocabulary">save considerable time and effort</span> that would otherwise be <span class="vocabulary">spent traveling</span> and <span class="vocabulary">queuing</span> in stores. <span class="causal">This is largely because</span> online platforms <span class="vocabulary">eliminate</span> the <span class="vocabulary">geographical and temporal constraints</span> of physical shopping.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">On the other hand</span>, <span class="causal">a significant disadvantage is that</span> online shopping <span class="vocabulary">seriously harms</span> local businesses and communities. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, many <span class="vocabulary">high street shops</span> have been <span class="vocabulary">forced to close</span> <span class="causal">due to</span> competition from <span class="vocabulary">major online retailers</span>, <span class="vocabulary">resulting in</span> <span class="vocabulary">job losses</span> and <span class="vocabulary">declining town centers</span>. <span class="causal">Consequently</span>, local economies <span class="vocabulary">suffer</span> as money flows to large corporations rather than <span class="vocabulary">staying within</span> the community. <span class="causal">This happens because</span> online giants can <span class="vocabulary">undercut prices</span> through <span class="vocabulary">economies of scale</span> that small businesses cannot <span class="vocabulary">match</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="causal">another important drawback is that</span> online shoppers cannot <span class="vocabulary">physically examine products</span> before purchasing. <span class="discourse">Consider the case of</span> buying clothes - shoppers cannot <span class="vocabulary">try items on</span>, <span class="vocabulary">feel fabric quality</span>, or <span class="vocabulary">assess</span> true colors and sizes. <span class="causal">Therefore</span>, many purchases <span class="vocabulary">result in disappointment</span> and <span class="vocabulary">require returns</span>, which is <span class="vocabulary">inconvenient and wasteful</span>. <span class="causal">This stems from</span> the fact that photographs often <span class="vocabulary">fail to accurately represent</span> products, and sizes <span class="vocabulary">vary significantly</span> between brands.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I believe that</span> neither online nor traditional shopping is <span class="vocabulary">universally better</span>. <span class="discourse">All things considered</span>, online shopping <span class="vocabulary">excels</span> in convenience, while physical stores <span class="vocabulary">provide</span> important <span class="vocabulary">tactile experiences</span> and <span class="vocabulary">support</span> local communities.

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">Few issues have divided opinion as much as</span> the <span class="vocabulary">enormous salaries</span> paid to professional athletes. <span class="causal">There has been heated discussion concerning whether</span> famous sports people <span class="vocabulary">deserve</span> such <span class="vocabulary">high wages</span>. <span class="opinion">Without doubt, I firmly believe that</span> sports stars are <span class="vocabulary">paid far too much money</span> compared to people in other professions.</p>

<p><span class="opinion">Admittedly</span>, sports people do provide <span class="vocabulary">entertainment</span> to millions of fans. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, football matches <span class="vocabulary">attract</span> <span class="vocabulary">packed stadiums</span> and <span class="vocabulary">huge television audiences</span>, bringing <span class="vocabulary">excitement</span> and <span class="vocabulary">enjoyment</span> to people's lives. <span class="opinion">However, I would argue that</span> this does not <span class="vocabulary">justify</span> earning millions of pounds per year. <span class="causal">The reason is that</span> other forms of entertainment, such as theater actors or musicians, provide <span class="vocabulary">equally valuable</span> experiences yet earn <span class="vocabulary">substantially less</span>. <span class="causal">This suggests that</span> sports salaries are <span class="vocabulary">disproportionate</span> rather than <span class="vocabulary">fair compensation</span> for entertainment value.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In addition</span>, some people argue that athletes <span class="vocabulary">work extremely hard</span> and <span class="vocabulary">make sacrifices</span>, <span class="vocabulary">training intensively</span> for years and <span class="vocabulary">risking injuries</span>. <span class="opinion">Nevertheless</span>, I maintain that many other professions <span class="vocabulary">involve equally demanding</span> work without <span class="vocabulary">receiving comparable rewards</span>. <span class="discourse">Consider the case of</span> doctors who <span class="vocabulary">study for decades</span>, work <span class="vocabulary">long, stressful hours</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">save lives daily</span>, yet earn a <span class="vocabulary">fraction</span> of what top athletes make. <span class="causal">This demonstrates that</span> hard work and dedication alone cannot <span class="vocabulary">justify</span> the <span class="vocabulary">extreme pay gap</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="causal">the most important reason is that</span> excessive sports salaries create <span class="vocabulary">unfair social values</span>. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, a <span class="vocabulary">professional footballer</span> can earn more in one week than a nurse earns in an entire year. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, young people may <span class="vocabulary">believe</span> that entertainment is <span class="vocabulary">more valuable</span> than <span class="vocabulary">essential services</span> like healthcare or education. <span class="causal">This happens because</span> society <span class="vocabulary">pays excessive attention to</span> sports while <span class="vocabulary">undervaluing</span> <span class="vocabulary">crucial professions</span> that <span class="vocabulary">contribute far more</span> to societal wellbeing.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I am convinced that</span> famous sports people are <span class="vocabulary">paid too much</span>. <span class="discourse">On balance</span>, society should <span class="vocabulary">reconsider</span> how it <span class="vocabulary">values</span> different professions and <span class="vocabulary">ensure fairer distribution</span> of wealth.</p>`

<p><span class="discourse">In addition</span>, some people claim that advertising <span class="vocabulary">encourages healthy competition</span> between companies. <span class="opinion">While this may be partly true</span>, it also <span class="vocabulary">results in</span> wasteful spending on marketing rather than <span class="vocabulary">improving product quality</span>. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, companies often <span class="vocabulary">invest millions</span> in <span class="vocabulary">flashy advertisements</span> while <span class="vocabulary">offering</span> <span class="vocabulary">inferior products</span>. <span class="causal">Consequently</span>, consumers pay <span class="vocabulary">higher prices</span> to <span class="vocabulary">cover</span> these <span class="vocabulary">enormous marketing budgets</span>. <span class="causal">This stems from</span> businesses <span class="vocabulary">prioritizing</span> <span class="vocabulary">brand image</span> over <span class="vocabulary">actual value</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Most importantly</span>, <span class="causal">the fundamental problem is that</span> advertising <span class="vocabulary">manipulates people's emotions</span> rather than <span class="vocabulary">providing genuine information</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, advertisements frequently <span class="vocabulary">create artificial needs</span> by suggesting that products will make people <span class="vocabulary">happier</span>, more <span class="vocabulary">attractive</span>, or more <span class="vocabulary">successful</span>. <span class="causal">This leads to</span> <span class="vocabulary">unnecessary spending</span> on items people do not <span class="vocabulary">actually need</span>. <span class="causal">This is largely because</span> advertisers <span class="vocabulary">employ psychological techniques</span> designed to <span class="vocabulary">exploit</span> people's <span class="vocabulary">insecurities</span> and <span class="vocabulary">desires</span>, <span class="vocabulary">resulting in</span> <span class="vocabulary">impulsive purchases</span> and <span class="vocabulary">financial problems</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I maintain that</span> advertising has a <span class="vocabulary">predominantly negative effect</span> on society. <span class="discourse">Taking everything into account</span>, it <span class="vocabulary">promotes</span> <span class="vocabulary">unsustainable consumption patterns</span> and <span class="vocabulary">manipulates</span> consumer behavior through <span class="vocabulary">emotional exploitation</span> rather than <span class="vocabulary">genuine information</span>.</p>`

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">Recent studies have shown that</span> products are being <span class="vocabulary">replaced more frequently</span> than ever before. <span class="causal">The question that remains unanswered is whether</span> products that <span class="vocabulary">last a long time</span> <span class="vocabulary">benefit society</span>. <span class="opinion">Without doubt, I believe that</span> long-lasting products are <span class="vocabulary">extremely positive</span> <span class="causal">because</span> they <span class="vocabulary">protect the environment</span> and <span class="vocabulary">provide better value</span> for consumers.</p>

<p><span class="opinion">Some people argue that</span> <span class="vocabulary">changing technology</span> makes old products <span class="vocabulary">obsolete</span>. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, smartphones and computers <span class="vocabulary">become outdated</span> as new models offer <span class="vocabulary">improved features</span>. <span class="opinion">However, I would argue that</span> this view is <span class="vocabulary">exaggerated</span>. <span class="causal">In reality</span>, basic functionality often <span class="vocabulary">remains useful</span> for years. <span class="discourse">Consider how</span> many people <span class="vocabulary">successfully use</span> computers and phones for five years or more. <span class="causal">This demonstrates that</span> society's obsession with <span class="vocabulary">the latest technology</span> is more about <span class="vocabulary">marketing</span> than genuine necessity.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Similarly</span>, some claim that <span class="vocabulary">fashion trends</span> make long-lasting items <span class="vocabulary">unfashionable</span>. <span class="opinion">While this may apply to</span> some products, <span class="vocabulary">quality items</span> with <span class="vocabulary">timeless design</span> <span class="vocabulary">remain attractive</span> regardless of <span class="vocabulary">temporary trends</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, <span class="vocabulary">well-made furniture</span> or <span class="vocabulary">classic clothing</span> can be <span class="vocabulary">updated</span> or <span class="vocabulary">adapted</span> rather than <span class="vocabulary">completely replaced</span>. <span class="causal">This is because</span> good design <span class="vocabulary">transcends</span> short-lived fashion <span class="vocabulary">fads</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Most importantly</span>, <span class="causal">the fundamental reason is that</span> durable products <span class="vocabulary">significantly reduce environmental damage</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, when items like phones or appliances <span class="vocabulary">last for many years</span> instead of just months, <span class="vocabulary">fewer resources</span> are needed for <span class="vocabulary">manufacturing replacements</span>. <span class="causal">Therefore</span>, this <span class="vocabulary">reduces pollution</span>, <span class="vocabulary">energy consumption</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">waste in landfills</span>. <span class="causal">This is because</span> producing new items requires <span class="vocabulary">mining raw materials</span>, <span class="vocabulary">factory production</span>, and transportation—all of which <span class="vocabulary">harm the environment</span>. Additionally, consumers <span class="vocabulary">save money</span> in the long term by purchasing <span class="vocabulary">quality products</span> that <span class="vocabulary">don't require frequent replacement</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">To conclude</span>, <span class="opinion">I am firmly convinced that</span> long-lasting products <span class="vocabulary">benefit both</span> the environment and consumers. <span class="discourse">In the final analysis</span>, society should <span class="vocabulary">prioritize durability</span> over <span class="vocabulary">disposable consumption</span>.</p>`

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">How concerned should we be about</span> <span class="vocabulary">helping others</span> in our community? <span class="causal">Increasingly, the question is being asked whether</span> everyone should regularly <span class="vocabulary">contribute to society</span>. <span class="opinion">I wholeheartedly agree with this statement</span> <span class="causal">because</span> helping others <span class="vocabulary">strengthens communities</span> and <span class="vocabulary">provides personal fulfillment</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">First of all</span>, <span class="causal">the most important factor is that</span> regular <span class="vocabulary">acts of kindness</span> create <span class="vocabulary">stronger, more connected communities</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, when neighbors help <span class="vocabulary">elderly residents</span> with shopping or young parents <span class="vocabulary">assist at local schools</span>, these actions <span class="vocabulary">build trust</span> and <span class="vocabulary">social bonds</span>. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, communities become <span class="vocabulary">safer, friendlier places</span> where people <span class="vocabulary">support each other</span> during <span class="vocabulary">difficult times</span>. <span class="causal">This is because</span> consistent <span class="vocabulary">helping behavior</span> creates a <span class="vocabulary">culture of mutual assistance</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="causal">another significant reason is that</span> everyone <span class="vocabulary">benefits from</span> society's resources and should <span class="vocabulary">give something back</span>. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, we all use <span class="vocabulary">public services</span> like education, healthcare, and infrastructure that are <span class="vocabulary">funded</span> and <span class="vocabulary">maintained collectively</span>. <span class="causal">Therefore</span>, it is only <span class="vocabulary">fair</span> that individuals <span class="vocabulary">contribute</span> through volunteering or <span class="vocabulary">community service</span>. <span class="causal">This stems from</span> the principle of <span class="vocabulary">social responsibility</span> - if we <span class="vocabulary">benefit from</span> society, we should <span class="vocabulary">help sustain</span> it.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In addition</span>, <span class="causal">one important benefit is that</span> helping others <span class="vocabulary">contributes to personal wellbeing</span> and happiness. <span class="discourse">Consider how</span> research consistently shows that volunteers <span class="vocabulary">report higher life satisfaction</span> and <span class="vocabulary">better mental health</span> than those who never help others. <span class="opinion">While some people argue they</span> <span class="vocabulary">lack time</span> for regular volunteering, <span class="opinion">I believe</span> even <span class="vocabulary">small acts matter</span>. Spending just one hour weekly at a <span class="vocabulary">food bank</span> or visiting <span class="vocabulary">isolated elderly neighbors</span> creates <span class="vocabulary">meaningful impact</span> for both the helper and those <span class="vocabulary">receiving assistance</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I am in total agreement that</span> everyone should do something regularly to <span class="vocabulary">help other people</span>. <span class="discourse">This essay has examined how</span> <span class="vocabulary">helping behavior</span> <span class="vocabulary">benefits both communities and individuals</span>, creating a <span class="vocabulary">more supportive</span>, <span class="vocabulary">connected society</span>.</p>`

<p><span class="opinion">Admittedly</span>, sports do <span class="vocabulary">teach teamwork</span> and <span class="vocabulary">cooperation skills</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, <span class="vocabulary">team sports</span> require players to <span class="vocabulary">communicate effectively</span>, <span class="vocabulary">support each other</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">work toward common goals</span>. <span class="opinion">However, I would argue that</span> these skills can be <span class="vocabulary">equally well developed</span> through <span class="vocabulary">alternative activities</span>. <span class="discourse">Consider how</span> drama productions, <span class="vocabulary">music ensembles</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">group projects</span> all require <span class="vocabulary">similar collaboration</span>. <span class="causal">This demonstrates that</span> teamwork is not <span class="vocabulary">exclusive to</span> sports.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Most importantly</span>, <span class="causal">the primary reason is that</span> forcing reluctant students to participate often creates <span class="vocabulary">lasting negative associations</span> with <span class="vocabulary">physical activity</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, students who <span class="vocabulary">lack natural athletic ability</span> may feel <span class="vocabulary">humiliated</span> during <span class="vocabulary">competitive sports</span>, <span class="vocabulary">leading them to</span> <span class="vocabulary">avoid all exercise</span> in adulthood. <span class="causal">This results in</span> exactly the <span class="vocabulary">opposite outcome</span> that schools <span class="vocabulary">intend to achieve</span>. <span class="causal">This is because</span> negative experiences during <span class="vocabulary">formative years</span> <span class="vocabulary">shape lifelong attitudes</span> toward fitness.</p>

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">Serious concerns are being expressed about</span> advertising <span class="vocabulary">targeted at young children</span>. <span class="causal">Alarm bells are ringing over</span> the effects of <span class="vocabulary">commercial marketing</span> on <span class="vocabulary">childhood development</span>. <span class="opinion">Without question, I firmly believe that</span> advertisements <span class="vocabulary">aimed at children</span> should <span class="vocabulary">not be allowed</span> <span class="causal">because</span> they <span class="vocabulary">manipulate vulnerable minds</span> and <span class="vocabulary">encourage unhealthy habits</span>.</p>

<p><span class="opinion">Some people argue that</span> child-targeted advertisements can be <span class="vocabulary">entertaining and fun</span>. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, colorful <span class="vocabulary">cartoon characters</span>, <span class="vocabulary">catchy songs</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">fun animations</span> can <span class="vocabulary">capture children's attention</span>. <span class="opinion">However, I find this argument unconvincing</span>. <span class="causal">The reason is that</span> this entertainment <span class="vocabulary">disguises</span> the <span class="vocabulary">manipulative purpose</span> of the advertising. Young children <span class="vocabulary">cannot distinguish between</span> entertainment and <span class="vocabulary">persuasive marketing</span>, making such advertisements <span class="vocabulary">fundamentally unfair</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="causal">a pressing concern is that</span> child-directed advertising <span class="vocabulary">promotes unhealthy</span> consumption patterns. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, companies <span class="vocabulary">heavily market</span> <span class="vocabulary">junk food</span>, <span class="vocabulary">sugary drinks</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">plastic toys</span> to children through television and <span class="vocabulary">online platforms</span>. <span class="causal">Consequently</span>, <span class="vocabulary">childhood obesity rates</span> and <span class="vocabulary">excessive materialism</span> have <span class="vocabulary">increased dramatically</span>. Additionally, advertisements create <span class="vocabulary">"pester power"</span> where children <span class="vocabulary">constantly demand</span> products they've seen advertised, <span class="vocabulary">putting enormous pressure</span> on families. <span class="causal">This can be attributed to</span> constant exposure to messages <span class="vocabulary">encouraging</span> <span class="vocabulary">poor dietary choices</span> and <span class="vocabulary">demanding</span> the latest products.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Most importantly</span>, <span class="causal">the fundamental problem is that</span> young children <span class="vocabulary">lack the cognitive ability</span> to <span class="vocabulary">recognize advertising intent</span>. <span class="discourse">Consider how</span> children under eight <span class="vocabulary">cannot understand</span> that <span class="vocabulary">persuasive techniques</span> are being <span class="vocabulary">used to influence</span> them. They <span class="vocabulary">believe claims literally</span> and <span class="vocabulary">trust</span> that advertisements are simply <span class="vocabulary">providing information</span> rather than <span class="vocabulary">attempting to sell</span> products. <span class="causal">This makes</span> child-targeted advertising <span class="vocabulary">fundamentally exploitative</span>, as it <span class="vocabulary">takes advantage of</span> <span class="vocabulary">psychological vulnerability</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">In conclusion</span>, <span class="opinion">I am convinced that</span> advertising to children should be <span class="vocabulary">banned</span>. <span class="discourse">After examining the evidence</span>, the <span class="vocabulary">psychological manipulation</span> and <span class="vocabulary">health consequences</span> clearly <span class="vocabulary">outweigh</span> any <span class="vocabulary">minor benefits</span>.</p>`

        answer: `<p><span class="discourse">It is common knowledge that</span> <span class="vocabulary">family structures</span> vary <span class="vocabulary">greatly</span> across different cultures and societies. <span class="causal">Few people would disagree that</span> family size <span class="vocabulary">significantly impacts</span> children's development. <span class="opinion">This essay will argue that</span> both large and small families offer <span class="vocabulary">distinct advantages</span>, and the <span class="vocabulary">ideal choice</span> depends on individual circumstances rather than <span class="vocabulary">following a universal rule</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">On the one hand</span>, <span class="causal">the key advantage of</span> large families is the <span class="vocabulary">social learning opportunities</span> they provide. <span class="discourse">For example</span>, children with <span class="vocabulary">multiple siblings</span> naturally <span class="vocabulary">develop strong</span> communication skills, learn to <span class="vocabulary">share resources</span>, and understand <span class="vocabulary">cooperation</span> through <span class="vocabulary">daily interactions</span>. <span class="causal">Consequently</span>, they often <span class="vocabulary">possess excellent social abilities</span> that <span class="vocabulary">benefit them throughout life</span>. <span class="causal">This is largely because</span> large families create <span class="vocabulary">constant opportunities</span> for <span class="vocabulary">negotiation and compromise</span>.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">On the other hand</span>, <span class="causal">a significant benefit of</span> small families is the <span class="vocabulary">greater individual attention</span> each child receives. <span class="discourse">For instance</span>, parents with one or two children can <span class="vocabulary">dedicate more time</span>, <span class="vocabulary">financial resources</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">emotional support</span> to each child's <span class="vocabulary">specific needs and interests</span>. <span class="causal">As a result</span>, children in small families may receive <span class="vocabulary">superior educational opportunities</span> and <span class="vocabulary">personalized guidance</span>. <span class="causal">This happens because</span> parents can <span class="vocabulary">focus intensively</span> on each child's development.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">Furthermore</span>, <span class="vocabulary">financial circumstances</span> play a <span class="vocabulary">crucial role</span>. Large families naturally require <span class="vocabulary">more resources</span> for food, clothing, education, and housing. <span class="opinion">While supporters argue that</span> costs can be <span class="vocabulary">spread across siblings</span>, <span class="opinion">I maintain that</span> <span class="vocabulary">total expenses</span> remain <span class="vocabulary">substantially higher</span>. <span class="opinion">However</span>, I believe that <span class="vocabulary">financial stability</span> matters more than size. <span class="discourse">Consider how</span> a wealthy large family might provide <span class="vocabulary">better opportunities</span> than a struggling small family.</p>

<p><span class="discourse">All things considered</span>, <span class="opinion">I believe</span> both family structures have <span class="vocabulary">value</span>. <span class="discourse">Taking everything into account</span>, factors like <span class="vocabulary">parental involvement</span>, <span class="vocabulary">financial stability</span>, and <span class="vocabulary">emotional support</span> matter more than the <span class="vocabulary">number of siblings</span>.</p>`
